      Since I recently rebuilt my gaming and development PC nearly from the
      ground up, I thought I would share some tips for anyone looking to
      build their own PC. Click on any of the links below to jump to a specific
      tip.

      <h3>The Motherboard Manual: The Build Bible</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have all of your components and are ready to build, take out
        the
        motherboard and read the manual. All of it. They are not very long but
        they contain almost all of the technical information you will need for
        the build. Having trouble finding a header? Check the manual. Don't know
        which RAM slots to use? Check the manual. Not sure how to install the
        CPU? Check the manual. It's all there. Also, once you start plugging
        things into the IO headers and panel, the diagrams are life savers.

      <h3>Minimize Static</h3>
      <p>
        Static is one of your worst enemies when building a PC so minimizing
        the chances of a static discharge goes a long way. You don't want to
        accidentally kill a component before it's even plugged into the
        motherboard. The best bet for preventing static discharges is to use
        an anti-static wristband. If one isn't available, you just have to be
        smart. Don't wear socks or slippers while on carpet, don't build
        on a conductive surface and always touch a conductive surface before
        handling a component. When I do a build at home, I will go barefoot
        just to make sure.

      <h3>Always Do a Bench Build First</h3>
      <p>
        A very common mistake for new builders is to put everything in the
        case before testing the system. It is almost a guarantee that
        something won't be quite right and you'll have to pull it all out
        again. This is a huge pain so a new builder should always
        do a bench build first and get the system to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test">POST</a>
        before installing
        everything in the case. To do this, set the motherboard on its box
        and begin plugging everything into it. The boxes are quite sturdy,
        non-conductive, and just the right size. Once everything is installed
        on the board and properly connected to the power supply, power it on
        (don't forget to flip the switch on the power supply, too). You can find
        how to turn the motherboard on in its manual. If it POSTs then all is
        swell and you can tear it down an put everything in the case. If
        not, then you have everything right in front of you, ready for
        troubleshooting.

    <div id="io-standoffs" class="post-section">
      <h3>Motherboard IO Shield and Case Standoffs First</h3>
      <p>
        Two other very common mistakes are forgetting to put the motherboard's
        IO shield in the case and installing motherboard without the case's
        standoff screws in place. The first just means that you have to pull
        everything out again while the second mistake is a sure fire way to
        fry your board and potentially everything plugged into it. When the
        standoffs are not in place, the board will make contact with the back
        of the case and cause a short. Thus, the first thing I do when I take
        the case out of its packaging is to install the standoffs followed by
        the IO shield. One thing to keep in mind when installing the IO shield
        is that the cut edges on it are incredibly sharp so treat it with
        respect when handling.

    <div id="push-harder" class="post-section">
      <h3>Installing RAM: Push Harder</h3>
      <p>
        When installing sticks of RAM on the motherboard, the answer to almost
        every problem is just push harder. RAM kits are notorious for
        requiring excessive amounts of force to insert. On one of the building
        forums that I frequent, there is a minimum of one post per month from
        people who think they are going to break their motherboard if they
        push any harder. The answer every time is push harder. Just make sure
        you have your RAM properly aligned with the DIMM slot.

    <div id="cable-man" class="post-section">
      <h3>Do the Cable Management as You Go</h3>
      <p>
        Not much to say here. Always do your cable management as you go. It
        will save you time and a lot of effort later, that is, if you even
        get to it later.
