<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>

  This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to

  The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year
  1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle.
  The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day
  heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p>

  This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!).
  It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way
  to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of
  our travels.

<h2>Sienna</h2>
<p>

  </a>
  The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent
  many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine
  at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape
  the sun.

<h2>Sienna Bakery</h2>
<p>

  We stopped at an amazing bakery in Sienna. It was almost as good as Bernice's
  Bakery in Missoula!
</p>

<h2>Tuscan Cathedral</h2>
<p>

  While in Sienna we stopped to explore a beautiful cathedral.

<h2>Lavender</h2>

  The house we stayed in was surrounded by beautiful lavender plants in full
  bloom.
